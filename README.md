## Linear Regrassion

Linear regression is an algorithm for modelling the relationship between a dependent and an independent variables. The dependent variable is the one under study, and the one that the model tries to predict. 

When we work with a single independent variable, we call it **simple linear regression**, when we have more than one, the process is called **multiple linear regression**.
